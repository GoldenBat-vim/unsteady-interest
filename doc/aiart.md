A young woman with short,
bob-cut auburn hair tied back with a blue ribbon.
She has delicate facial features with large,
melancholic eyes,
subtle tears, and a thoughtful expression.
Her outfit consists of a cream-colored,
frilly dress with a black strap and matching lace stockings adorned with small blue bows.
She has a vibrant red tattoo of a spider lily on her upper arm.
The scene is minimalist with a soft,
pastel color palette and a focus on the detailed,
anime-style character design, evoking a sense of quiet introspection
